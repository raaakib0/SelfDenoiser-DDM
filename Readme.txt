SelfDenoiser: A Self-Supervised Approach to Enhancing Image Quality Through Denoising

What is DDM
Denoising diffusion models (DDMs) have led to staggering performance leaps in image generation, editing and restoration. However, existing DDMs use very large datasets for training. Here, we introduce a framework for training a DDM on a single image
